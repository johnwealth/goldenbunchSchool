                        Learning about long-term commitments<br>
                        Making contributions<br>
                        Self-esteem<br>

                            <p>
                               The Reading Club was set up to improve the effective use of the English language and Communication skills among the pupils.The club is being promoted through the use of phonic skills. This has made it easy for the children to read early in life. Golden Bunch pupils are able to overcome reading difficulty and problems so early. By the age of 5, they can read fluently any story book, newspaper, and other reading materials.</p>

                                Divine Nature Assembly is the school fellowship programme. Here, pupils’ spiritual growth is being attended to on a daily basis during the assembly and Friday fellowship. It’s a Christian based programme. Staff members are delegated to perform devotional activities to help the children. Through this, we are able to instill “respect”. In the end Christian virtues like trust, honesty, obedience, and fear of God is taken in high esteem throughout the childhood days.
